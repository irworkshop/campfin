#' \code{campfin} package
#'
#' The campfin package was written to facilitate the work done on The
#' Accountability Project (TAP) by the data journalists at The Investigative
#' Reporting Workshop in Washington, DC.
#'
#' TAP is an effort to centralize many public databases into a searchable
#' website. To improve the searchability of the database, the campfin package
#' is used to normalize values in a common format. The normalization vignette
#' provides examples on how this process improved a database.
#'
#' The other functions in this package are written to facilitate the exploration
#' of a database. The Investigative Reporting Workshop writes public data
#' diaries to document the data wrangling process; the open source campfin
#' functions help download, import, explore, and wrangle public database.
