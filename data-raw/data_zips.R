## > This package contains a database of city, state, latitude, and longitude
## information for U.S. ZIP codes from the CivicSpace Database (August 2004)
## augmented by Daniel Coven's federalgovernmentzipcodes.us web site (updated
## January 22, 2012). Previous versions of this package (before 1.0) were based
## solely on the CivicSpace data, so an original version of the CivicSpace
## database is also included.

# CivicSpace US ZIP Code Database by Schuyler Erle <schuyler@geocoder.us>

## > The ZIP code database contains 43191 ZIP codes for the continetal United
## States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa...

## > This database was composed using ZIP code gazetteers from the US Census
## Bureau from 1999 and 2000, augmented with additional ZIP code information
## from the Census Bureauâ€™s TIGER/Line 2003 data set.... The database is
## guaranteed to exclusively contain information gathered from sources in the
## public domain, and thus be legal to redistribute.

## > The database is believed to contain over 98% of the ZIP Codes in current
## use in the United States. The remaining ZIP Codes absent from this database
## are entirely PO Box or Firm ZIP codes added in the last five years, which
## are no longer published by the Census Bureau, but in any event serve a very
## small minority of the population (probably on the order of .1% or less).
## Although every attempt has been made to filter them out, this data set may
## contain up to .5% false positives, that is, ZIP codes that do not exist or
## are no longer in use but are included due to erroneous data sources...

## > The database andthis README are copyright 2004 CivicSpace Labs, Inc., and
