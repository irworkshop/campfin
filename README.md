The campfin package was created to facilitate the work being done on the
[The Accountability Project](https://www.publicaccountability.org/), a
tool created by [The Investigative Reporting
Workshop](https://investigativereportingworkshop.org/) in Washington,
DC. The Accountability Project curates, cleans, and indexes public data
to give journalists, researchers and others a simple way to search
across otherwise siloed records.

The data focuses on people, organizations and locations. This package
was created specifically to help with state-level campaign finance data,
although the tools included are useful in general database exploration
and normalization.

## Installation

You can install the released version of campfin from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=campfin) with:

``` r
install.packages("campfin")
```

The development version can be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/irworkshop/campfin) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("irworkshop/campfin")
```

## Normalize

The package was originally built to normalize geographic data using the
`normal_*()` functions, which take the messy self-reported geographic
data of a contributor, vendor, candidate, or committee and return
[normalized text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_normalization) that
is more searchable. They are largely wrappers around the
[stringr](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr) package, and can call
other sub-functions to streamline normalization.

  - `normal_address()` takes a *street* address and reduces
    inconsistencies.
  - `normal_zip()` takes [ZIP
    Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code) and aims to return a
    valid 5-digit code.
  - `normal_state()` takes US states and returns a [2 digit
    abbreviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_abbreviations).
  - `normal_city()` takes cities and reduces inconsistencies.
  - `normal_phone()` consistently formats US telephone numbers.

Please see the vignette on normalization for an example of how these
functions are used to fix a wide variety of string inconsistencies and
make campaign finance data more consistent. In general, these functions
fix the following inconsistencies:

  - Capitalize with `str_to_upper()`
  - Replace hyphens and underscores with `str_replace()`
  - Remove remaining punctuation with `str_remove()`
  - Remove either numbers or letters (depending on data) with
    `str_remove()`
  - Remove excess white space with `str_trim()` and `str_squish()`
  - Abbreviate addresses with `abbrev_full()` (and `str_replace_all()`)
  - Remove invalid values with `na_out()` (and `str_which()`)

## Data

``` r
if (!require(zipcode, quietly = TRUE)) {
  zip_url <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/zipcode/zipcode_1.0.tar.gz"
  install.packages(zip_url, repos = NULL, type = "source")
}
library(zipcode)
library(campfin)
library(tidyverse)
```

The campfin package contains a number of built in data frames and
strings used to help wrangle campaign finance data.

    #>  [1] "dark2"        "extra_city"   "invalid_city" "rx_phone"     "rx_state"     "rx_url"      
    #>  [7] "rx_zip"       "usps_city"    "usps_state"   "usps_street"  "valid_abb"    "valid_city"  
    #> [13] "valid_name"   "valid_state"  "valid_zip"    "zipcodes"

The `/data-raw` directory contains the code used to create the objects.

### zipcodes

The `zipcodes` (plural) table is a new version of the `zipcode`
(singular) table from the archived
[zipcode](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/zipcode/) R
package.

> This database was composed using ZIP code gazetteers from the US
> Census Bureau from 1999 and 2000, augmented with additional ZIP code
> information The database is believed to contain over 98% of the ZIP
> Codes in current use in the United States. The remaining ZIP Codes
> absent from this database are entirely PO Box or Firm ZIP codes added
> in the last five years, which are no longer published by the Census
> Bureau, but in any event serve a very small minority of the population
> (probably on the order of .1% or less). Although every attempt has
> been made to filter them out, this data set may contain up to .5%
> false positives, that is, ZIP codes that do not exist or are no longer
> in use but are included due to erroneous data sources.

The included `valid_city` and `valid_zip` vectors are sorted, unique
columns from the `zipcodes` data frame.

``` r
# zipcode version
data("zipcode")
sample_n(zipcode, 3)
#>     zip        city state latitude longitude
#> 1 15697   Youngwood    PA 40.23813 -79.58172
#> 2 25090 Glen Ferris    WV 38.14906 -81.21276
#> 3 22969    Schuyler    VA 37.79234 -78.69417

# campfin version
sample_n(zipcodes, 3)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 3
#>   city      state zip  
#>   <chr>     <chr> <chr>
#> 1 ALHAMBRA  CA    91801
#> 2 LONG LAKE NY    12847
#> 3 AUGUSTA   MT    59410
```

### `usps_*` and `valid_*`

The `usps_*` data frames were scraped from the official United States
Postal Service (USPS) [Postal Addressing
Standards](https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28apc_002.htm). These data
frames are designed to work with the abbreviation functionality of
`normal_address()` and `normal_city()` to replace common abbreviations
with their full equivalent.

`usps_city` is a curated subset of `usps_state`, whose full version
appear at least once in the `valid_city` vector from `zipcodes`. The
`valid_state` and `valid_name` vectors contain the columns from
`usps_state` and include territories not found in Râ€™s build in
`state.abb` and `state.name` vectors.

``` r
sample_n(usps_street, 3)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   full  abb  
#>   <chr> <chr>
#> 1 VIEW  VW   
#> 2 HWAY  HWY  
#> 3 UNION UN
sample_n(usps_state, 3)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>   full                 abb  
#>   <chr>                <chr>
#> 1 NEBRASKA             NE   
#> 2 ARMED FORCES PACIFIC AP   
#> 3 VERMONT              VT
setdiff(valid_state, state.abb)
#>  [1] "AS" "AA" "AE" "AP" "DC" "FM" "GU" "MH" "MP" "PW" "PR" "VI"
```
