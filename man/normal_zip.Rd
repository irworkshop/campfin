\title{Normalize US ZIP Codes}
\usage{
normal_zip(zip, na = c("", "NA"), na_rep = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{zip}{A vector of US ZIP codes.}

\item{na}{A vector of values to replace with \code{NA}.}

\item{na_rep}{logical; If \code{TRUE}, make all single digit repeating strings
(e.g., "00000", "99999") \code{NA}. The valid ZIP codes "22222", "44444", and
"55555" are not removed.}
}
\value{
A vector of normalized 5-digit ZIP codes.
}
\description{
Return consistent version US ZIP codes using \code{stringr::str_*()}
functions. Non-number characters are removed, strings are padded with
zeroes on the left (leading zeroes for New England ZIP codes are often
removed by Microsoft Excel and other progrmas), and ZIP+4 suffixes are
removed. Invalid ZIP codes from a vector can be removed as well as single
(repeating) character strings.

\details{
From \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code#ZIP+4}{Wikipedia}:

In 1983, the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system
that it called ZIP+4, often called "plus-four codes", "add-on codes", or
"add-ons". A ZIP+4 Code uses the basic five-digit code plus four additional
digits to identify a geographic segment within the five-digit delivery
area, such as a city block, a group of apartments, an individual
high-volume receiver of mail, a post office box, or any other unit that
could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and
delivery. However, initial attempts to promote universal use of the new
format met with public resistance and today the plus-four code is not
required.
