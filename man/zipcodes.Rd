\description{
This tibble is the third version of a popular zipcodes database.
The original CivicSpace US ZIP Code Database was created by Schuyler Erle
using ZIP code gazetteers from the US Census Bureau from 1999 and 2000,
augmented with additional ZIP code information from the Census Bureauâ€™s
TIGER/Line 2003 data set. The second version was published as the
\code{zipcode::zipcode} dataframe object. This version has dropped the latitude
and longitude, reorganized columns, and normalize the city values with
\code{\link[=normal_city]{normal_city()}}.
